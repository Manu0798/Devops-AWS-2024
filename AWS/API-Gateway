# What is an API
-> API stands application programming interface which helps us to establish communication between two diffenent applications

# What are the Methods of API
-> We have so many methods but mostly we will use only four methos
   -> GET
        Purpose: Retrieve data from the server without making any changes.
        Example: Fetch a list of users or get details about a specific item.
        Idempotent: Yes, meaning multiple calls with the same parameters should return the same result without side effects.
        Example Request: GET /users/123
   -> PUT
        Purpose: Update an existing resource, typically by replacing it with new data. It can also be used to create a resource if it doesn't already exist.
        Example: Update user information.
        Idempotent: Yes, meaning calling the same PUT request multiple times will result in the same resource state.
        Example Request: PUT /users/123 (with a body containing updated user data)
   -> POST
        Purpose: Send data to the server to create a new resource or trigger an action. The server often responds with the created resource or a status message.
        Example: Create a new user or submit a form.
        Idempotent: No, meaning calling the same POST request multiple times may result in different outcomes (e.g., multiple records created).
        Example Request: POST /users (with a body containing user data)
   -> DELETE
        Purpose: Remove a resource from the server.
        Example: Delete a user or remove a product from the system.
        Idempotent: Yes, calling DELETE multiple times will have the same result (the resource will already be deleted).
        Example Request: DELETE /users/123


# What is API-Gateway
-> The API-Gateway is a service provided by AWS which is used to create, publish, maintain and secure veriour APIs Such as REST, HTTP, and Web socket

REST API: AWS API Gateway can create RESTful APIs that follow the REST architectural principles, supporting CRUD operations over HTTP.
HTTP API: HTTP APIs provide a lightweight version of the REST API that focuses on low-latency, cost-effective communication, suitable for simpler use cases.
WebSocket API: AWS API Gateway also supports WebSocket APIs, enabling real-time, full-duplex communication between clients and servers.

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete. 

# Features of API-Gateway
-> Support Stateful(Websocket) and Stateless(HTTP and REST) APIs.
-> Highly Secured authentication mechanisam
-> Cloud watch logging support which helps to monitor the API performance
-> Supports Custom domain names
-> Interaction with AWS X-ray (To interact with other services in AWS like lambda)


# How to create API-Gateway
-> Go to API-Gateway in AWS console
-> Click Build on Rest API
-> Click NEW API, Give name and Select regional in API endpoint type
-> Click create
-> AFter create API, You have to create Resource, Click create resource, give resource name and create resource name
-> After create resource you have to create method in method you have select method type like (get, put, post, delete), click lambda and ARN. To trigger with lambda
-> After complete to create method, click deploy API and write the stage whichever stage do you want use the API and create
-> Go to stages and copy API and paste over the internet.
