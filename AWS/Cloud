# What is Cloud
-> Cloud (short for cloud computing) means using the internet to store, manage, and process data — instead of using your local computer or on-premise servers.
-> The cloud is like renting computing power, storage, or services from a data center managed by someone else (like AWS, Google Cloud, oracle, or Microsoft Azure).

-> All the above Cloud services that allow businesses to build, run and manage the wide range of applications and workloads in a highly format, secure and scalable environment.

-> These services are categorized into three parts
| Category                               | Description                              | Examples                          |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service) | Rent virtual machines, storage, networks | AWS EC2, Azure VM                 |
| **PaaS** (Platform as a Service)       | Deploy apps without managing servers     | AWS App Runner, Google App Engine |
| **SaaS** (Software as a Service)       | Use ready-made apps online               | Gmail, Zoom, Salesforce           |


# What is a Region?
-> A region is a geographical area — like Asia Pacific (Mumbai) — where AWS hosts its cloud infrastructure.
Each region is completely independent, with its own:
Power, cooling, and networking
-> Each region having one or more Availability Zones (AZs)
-> Each AZ represents a separate data center (or cluster of data centers) within the same region.

# What is an Availability Zone (AZ)?
Each Availability Zone is an isolated data center (or multiple data centers) with:
Independent power and cooling.
High-speed private fiber connections between AZs (low latency).
Physical separation (usually 10–50 km apart) within the same region.


# What are AWS Edge Locations?
-> Edge Locations are AWS data centers located closer to end-users than the main regions.

📍 In India, AWS has multiple edge locations, for example:
Mumbai
Chennai
Hyderabad
New Delhi
Bengaluru
Kolkata

-> When someone in India accesses your app, CloudFront automatically serves the content from the nearest edge location — instead of always reaching your main AWS region (e.g., ap-south-1 in Mumbai).
