# What is Virtualization?
-> Virtualization is a technology that allows a single physical computer (referred to as the host) to run multiple virtual computers, known as virtual machines (VMs). 
-> Each virtual machine operates independently with its own operating system, storage, and applications, all while utilizing the same physical hardware.

# Why is Virtualization Useful?
-> Improves Resource Efficiency:- Maximizes the usage of hardware by running multiple VMs on a single machine, reducing idle resources.
-> Reduces Hardware Costs:- Avoids the need for multiple physical machines by creating virtual ones on a single host.
-> Simplifies Management:- Easier to manage multiple environments on a centralized host rather than several individual computers.


# What is The Role of Hypervisors in Virtualization
-> A hypervisor is software that sits between the host machine's physical hardware and its virtual machines. 
-> It manages resource allocation and ensures each VM operates independently.


# What are the types of hypervisors
-> Type 1 (Bare-Metal): Runs directly on physical hardware, highly efficient for data centers (e.g., VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V).
-> Type 2 (Hosted): Operates on top of an existing operating system, suitable for testing (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware Workstation).

# Example of Hypervisor Functionality
-> Imagine a server with 64 GB RAM and a powerful CPU. 
-> A hypervisor can divide this server into multiple VMs, each allocated specific CPU and memory resources, enabling separate environments for different applications.


# Understanding Virtual Machines (VMs)
-> A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based computer that uses the physical resources of the host. Each VM operates independently, with its own OS and applications.

# Benefits of VMs:
-> Isolation: Each VM operates independently, minimizing the risk of interference.
-> Scalability: Resources can be easily adjusted as needed.
-> Portability: VMs can be moved across different hardware or environments without issues.

# Transition to EC2 with Virtualization Context
How EC2 Uses Virtualization
Amazon EC2 leverages virtualization to provide scalable virtual machines, referred to as instances, in the cloud. These instances offer:
-> Elasticity: On-demand creation, resizing, and termination of instances based on workloads.
-> Resource Management: AWS manages physical servers and hypervisors, ensuring optimal resource allocation.

# Benefits of EC2 Over Traditional VMs
-> On-Demand Resource Availability
    Launch and terminate instances as required, with flexible pricing models.
-> Simplified Management
    AWS takes care of the underlying infrastructure, allowing users to focus on application-level management.
-> Wide Range of Instance Types
    Select from a variety of instance types optimized for specific workloads.


# What is Ec2 instance
-> Ec2 stands for Elastic computer cloud in aws.
-> It is virtual server in AWS.
-> It provide the computing resources for running the application. 

# What is benefits of Ec2
-> Easier and faster
-> Elastic and scalable 
-> High Availablity
-> Cost effective

# EC2 Instances
An EC2 instance is essentially a VM running on AWS.

Key Features:
Scalability: Adjust resources as needed.
Flexible Pricing: Choose On-Demand, Reserved, Scheduled, Spot instances, Dedicated and saving plan
Customizability: Configure OS, storage, network settings, and more.

# Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)
An AMI is a template for launching EC2 instances, containing an OS and optional software configurations.

Types of AMIs:
AWS-provided (e.g., Amazon Linux, Ubuntu).
Community AMIs (pre-configured by other users).
Custom AMIs (user-created for specific needs).

# Just Remember
Disable SSH Post-Setup:
Use bastion hosts or VPNs for secure access.
