# AWS offers a range of storage services
-> Object level Storage  (S3)
-> Block level Storage   (EBS)
-> File level Storage    (EFS & FSX)
-> Hybrid level Storage  

# What is Object level Stroge
-> S3: Amazon S3 is a highly scalable object storage service that allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere.

# What is Block level Storage
EBS: Amazon EBS is a high-performance block storage service designed for use with EC2 instances.

# What is File level Storage
-> EFS: A serverless, fully managed NFS file system for Linux workloads.
-> FSx: Managed file systems for Windows (FSx for Windows File Server), Lustre (FSx for Lustre), and other specialized workloads.

# What is Hybrid level Stroage
