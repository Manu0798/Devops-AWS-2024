If you want to purchase an on-demand EC2 instance with the following specifications:

Instance Type: t3.large (2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM)
EBS Volume: 25 GB
Tenancy: Shared (default)
Here’s how you can estimate the cost and proceed:

1. Cost Calculation (On-Demand Pricing)
T3.large Hourly Rate: Pricing varies by region. For example:

US East (N. Virginia): ~$0.0832 per hour
Check AWS EC2 Pricing for the specific region.
EBS Storage: General Purpose SSD (gp2 or gp3) costs ~$0.10 per GB per month.

25 GB x $0.10 = $2.50/month (if you store data for the whole month).
2. Steps to Launch the Instance
a. Login to AWS Management Console
Navigate to EC2 Service.
b. Select the Region
Choose the region where you want to deploy the instance.
c. Launch an EC2 Instance
Go to "Instances" > Click "Launch Instances."
d. Choose AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
Select the OS (e.g., Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, etc.).
e. Choose Instance Type
Select t3.large.
f. Configure Instance Details
Tenancy: Shared (default setting).
Configure additional settings like VPC, IAM roles, etc.
g. Add Storage
Specify 25 GB for the root EBS volume.
h. Add Tags (Optional)
Add tags for management purposes.
i. Configure Security Group
Set up inbound and outbound rules for the instance.
j. Review and Launch
Review the configuration and launch the instance.
Select or create a key pair for SSH access.
3. Considerations
Cost Management: Use AWS Cost Explorer or set up billing alerts to track usage.
Reserved Instances or Savings Plan: If you need the instance for a long-term workload, consider Reserved Instances or a Savings Plan for cost savings.

Can you give the cost data to reserved instance with same specifications
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
For a Reserved Instance in the Mumbai region (ap-south-1) with the same specifications as your on-demand instance (t3.large, 2 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM, 25 GB EBS storage), the cost will be significantly lower compared to on-demand pricing, as AWS offers significant discounts for reserving instances for a one-year or three-year term.

1. Reserved Instance Pricing (t3.large)
Pricing Options:
Term Length: You can choose either a 1-year or 3-year term.
Payment Options: AWS offers different payment options:
All Upfront: Pay for the entire term at the start.
Partial Upfront: Pay part of the cost upfront and the rest in monthly installments.
No Upfront: Pay in monthly installments for the entire term.
Here’s an estimate of the t3.large Reserved Instance pricing in the Mumbai region:

Pricing for 1-Year and 3-Year Reserved Instances
Term	Payment Option	Hourly Rate (approx.)	Monthly Cost (approx.)	Total Cost (1-Year)	Total Cost (3-Year)
1-Year	All Upfront	₹ 4.50 per hour	₹ 3,240	₹ 38,880	-
Partial Upfront	₹ 4.70 per hour	₹ 3,380	₹ 40,560	-
No Upfront	₹ 5.00 per hour	₹ 3,600	₹ 43,200	-
3-Year	All Upfront	₹ 3.90 per hour	₹ 2,805	-	₹ 100,980
Partial Upfront	₹ 4.20 per hour	₹ 3,024	-	₹ 107,760
No Upfront	₹ 4.50 per hour	₹ 3,240	-	₹ 116,640
2. EBS Storage Pricing
For EBS storage, the cost is the same regardless of whether you use an on-demand or reserved instance. So, you would still pay the same ₹ 8.10 per GB per month for your 25 GB of General Purpose SSD (gp2 or gp3) storage.

EBS storage cost: 25 GB x ₹ 8.10 = ₹ 202.5 per month
3. Key Benefits of Reserved Instances:
Cost Savings: Significant discounts (up to 75% or more) compared to on-demand pricing.
Predictable Costs: Reserved Instances provide a predictable, fixed cost for the term you select, making budgeting easier.
Flexible Use: You can modify some aspects of the Reserved Instances during the term (e.g., change the instance family, size, or region) through the Convertible Reserved Instance option, but this may come with some restrictions and changes in pricing.
4. Example Total Cost for 1-Year and 3-Year Term:
For example, if you choose the 1-Year All Upfront option:

Instance Cost: ₹ 38,880 for the entire year.
EBS Storage: ₹ 202.5/month = ₹ 2,430 for the year.
Total Cost for 1 Year: ₹ 38,880 + ₹ 2,430 = ₹ 41,310.
For a 3-Year All Upfront option:

Instance Cost: ₹ 100,980 for 3 years.
EBS Storage: ₹ 202.5/month x 36 months = ₹ 7,290 for 3 years.
Total Cost for 3 Years: ₹ 100,980 + ₹ 7,290 = ₹ 108,270.
5. How to Purchase a Reserved Instance:
Log in to the AWS Management Console.
Navigate to EC2 Dashboard and select Reserved Instances.
Choose the Instance Type (t3.large), Region (Mumbai), and your preferred payment option.
Follow the steps to purchase and reserve the instance for your desired term.

Can you give the cost data to saving plans with same specifications
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
For AWS Savings Plans, you can save significantly on EC2 instance costs in exchange for committing to a one- or three-year term. Savings Plans are more flexible than Reserved Instances as they apply to a broader range of instance types and sizes, and they can also apply to usage across different regions, families, and operating systems.

Here’s how the Savings Plans would work for your t3.large instance with 25 GB of EBS storage in the Mumbai region (ap-south-1).

1. Savings Plan Overview
There are two types of Savings Plans:

Compute Savings Plan: Provides flexibility to apply savings to any EC2 instance regardless of family, size, region, operating system, or tenancy. It can also apply to AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate.
EC2 Instance Savings Plan: Provides savings when you commit to specific instance families (e.g., t3.large) in a specific region (e.g., Mumbai). This type of Savings Plan is less flexible than the Compute Savings Plan.
2. Pricing for Savings Plans
AWS offers 1-year and 3-year terms for both types of Savings Plans, with payment options:

All Upfront: Pay the full cost at the beginning.
Partial Upfront: Pay part upfront and the rest in monthly installments.
No Upfront: Pay in monthly installments.
Savings Plan Pricing for t3.large in Mumbai region:
Plan Type	Term	Payment Option	Hourly Rate (approx.)	Monthly Cost (approx.)
Compute Savings Plan	1 Year	All Upfront	₹ 3.90	₹ 2,805
Partial Upfront	₹ 4.10	₹ 2,940
No Upfront	₹ 4.30	₹ 3,120
Compute Savings Plan	3 Year	All Upfront	₹ 3.40	₹ 2,448
Partial Upfront	₹ 3.60	₹ 2,592
No Upfront	₹ 3.80	₹ 2,760
EC2 Instance Savings Plan	1 Year	All Upfront	₹ 3.60	₹ 2,592
Partial Upfront	₹ 3.80	₹ 2,760
No Upfront	₹ 4.00	₹ 2,880
EC2 Instance Savings Plan	3 Year	All Upfront	₹ 3.10	₹ 2,232
Partial Upfront	₹ 3.30	₹ 2,376
No Upfront	₹ 3.50	₹ 2,520
3. EBS Storage Cost
EBS storage: ₹ 8.10 per GB per month for General Purpose SSD (gp2 or gp3).
For 25 GB of storage, the cost would be:
25 GB x ₹ 8.10 = ₹ 202.5 per month.
4. Total Monthly and Yearly Costs for Savings Plans
Here’s an estimate of the total monthly cost for a 1-Year and 3-Year term with different payment options.

1-Year Compute Savings Plan (Example)
Monthly Instance Cost (Compute Savings Plan): ₹ 2,805
Monthly EBS Storage Cost: ₹ 202.5
Total Monthly Cost: ₹ 3,007.5
Total Yearly Cost: ₹ 3,007.5 x 12 = ₹ 36,090
3-Year Compute Savings Plan (Example)
Monthly Instance Cost (Compute Savings Plan): ₹ 2,448
Monthly EBS Storage Cost: ₹ 202.5
Total Monthly Cost: ₹ 2,650.5
Total 3-Year Cost: ₹ 2,650.5 x 36 = ₹ 95,382
1-Year EC2 Instance Savings Plan (Example)
Monthly Instance Cost (EC2 Savings Plan): ₹ 2,592
Monthly EBS Storage Cost: ₹ 202.5
Total Monthly Cost: ₹ 2,794.5
Total Yearly Cost: ₹ 2,794.5 x 12 = ₹ 33,534
3-Year EC2 Instance Savings Plan (Example)
Monthly Instance Cost (EC2 Savings Plan): ₹ 2,232
Monthly EBS Storage Cost: ₹ 202.5
Total Monthly Cost: ₹ 2,434.5
Total 3-Year Cost: ₹ 2,434.5 x 36 = ₹ 87,654
5. How to Purchase a Savings Plan
To purchase a Savings Plan in the AWS Console:

Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
Click on Savings Plans.
Choose between Compute Savings Plan or EC2 Instance Savings Plan.
Select the instance type (t3.large), region (Mumbai), term length (1-year or 3-year), and payment option.
Follow the steps to purchase the Savings Plan.
6. Benefits of Savings Plans:
Flexibility: Especially the Compute Savings Plan that allows you to switch between instance families, sizes, and even regions while still benefiting from the savings.
Cost Reduction: Significant savings compared to on-demand pricing.
Summary:
1-Year Term: Monthly costs around ₹ 3,007.5 (Compute Savings Plan).
