# what is snyc
Snyk is a developer-first security platform that helps you find and fix vulnerabilities in your applications, containers, and infrastructure as code (IaC). 
It's widely used for securing modern DevOps workflows and integrates seamlessly with tools like GitHub, Bitbucket, Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.

From the image you've shared, you're looking at a Snyk project with the following scans:

Dockerfile – Snyk scans it for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

package.json – Snyk scans your dependencies (e.g., npm packages).

Code analysis – Here's what it means in Snyk vs. SonarQube:

🔍 "Code Analysis" in Snyk:
In Snyk, code analysis refers to scanning your open source dependencies and their usage in your codebase. It's known as Snyk Code, which is a static application security testing (SAST) tool.

✅ Detects vulnerabilities in your custom source code (like insecure APIs, SQL injections, XSS, etc.).

✅ Focuses on security issues, not on code quality or maintainability.

❗ Doesn’t do code smells, duplication, or maintainability scoring like SonarQube.

Example:

If you write code like eval(userInput), Snyk Code will flag that as a security issue, not a quality issue.

🧠 "Code Analysis" in SonarQube:
In SonarQube, code analysis is more comprehensive and focused on:

✅ Code Quality (maintainability, duplication, formatting, complexity)

✅ Code Security (injection flaws, access control, etc.)

✅ Code Smells, Bugs, Vulnerabilities, and Technical Debt

❌ It does not scan third-party dependencies (e.g., npm libraries) unless paired with something like Snyk or Trivy.

🔁 Summary Comparison

Feature	Snyk Code Analysis	SonarQube Code Analysis
Focus	Security flaws in custom code	Security, bugs, code quality
Type	SAST	SAST + quality + maintainability
Dependency Scanning	✅ Yes (separate module)	❌ No
Detects Security Flaws	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
Detects Code Quality Issues	❌ No	✅ Yes
