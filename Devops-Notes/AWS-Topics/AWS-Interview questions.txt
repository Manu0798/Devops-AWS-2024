Note: one IP having 4 octet
      one octet having 8 bites
      one bytes having 8 bites

# What is subnet
-> Subnets are associated with route tables that control the traffic flow within the VPC. 
-> Public subnets typically have a route to an Internet Gateway (IGW) to allow internet access for resources within the subnet, while private subnets route traffic through NAT gateways.

# What is VPC
-> VPC stands for virtual provide cloud in aws. 
-> It is virtual network in AWS
-> It allow you to control your vitual network environment.

Note: We can assign the ips using CIDR
      CIDR stands for Classes inter Domain Range.
# Ranges
  10.0.0.0/16  -> This is one ipv4 range
  this comes upto 65535 because above ip is ipv4 ip it have 32 bit and above ip range is 16
  32 -16       16
 2        ->  2     -> two power 16 is 65536 but we will take 65535
because 65536 it is allocated to broad casting it wont work in AWS network.

-> Highest range is 16 in VPC
-> Lowest range is 28 in VPC
   10.0.0.0/16  = 65536
                    32-32
   10.0.0.0/32  = 2        = 0
                    32-31         1
   10.0.0.0/32  = 2        = 1 = 2  = 2
                    32-30         2
   10.0.0.0/32  = 2        = 2 = 2  = 4
                    32-29         3
   10.0.0.0/32  = 2        = 3 = 2  = 8
                    32-28         4
   10.0.0.0/32  = 2        = 2 = 2  = 16

-> If you have 8 even VPC dont allow that range
-> Mostly 16 and 24 ranges will be use in VPC.
   
# What is the difference between pubilc Ip and private Ip or subnets
-> Public Ip having internet access
-> Private Ip dont having internet access
