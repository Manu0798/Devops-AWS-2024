# What is DynamoDB(NOSQL)
-> It is serverless and NOSQL database
-> Store Unstructured, Semi-Structured, or Structured Data.
-> Handle Large volumes of data at high speed
-> Very fast while retrieving the data
-> Provides vert fast throughput with low latency
-> Pay only what you used
-> Fault Tolerant
   It automatically replicates the data to multiple avaliablity zones(AZs).
   In case any failure happen at one AZ, automatically the data will be fetched from anothe AZ
-> It is highly secured
-> Developer-Friendly
-> Take full Advantage of the cloud to deliver Zero Downtime.

# NoSQL Supports database
-> DynamoDB
-> MongoDB
-> cassandra
-> Azure CosmosDB
-> CouchDb
-> Apache HBASE

# NoSQL Database Modles
-> Document-Based Database
-> Grapg-Based Database
-> wide column Based Database
-> Key-value Database


# Differnece between RDS and DynamoDB
# RDS
-> Data save in Table format in RDS
-> Schema and relational structure in RDS
-> Limitions to add the data in RDS
-> RDS is not a replacement to NOSQL

# DynamoDB(NOSQL)
-> Data save in JSON format in dynamodb
-> NoSql databases concept was emerged to overcome the limitations of traditional relational databases.
-> When compared to relational databases like SQL Server, MYSQL, Oracel etc.., NoSQL databases are highly scalable flexible and faster
-> Schemaless and non relational structure in NoSQL
-> No adding limitons to NoSQl
-> NoSQL is not a replacement to RDS

# Core Components of amazon DynamoDB
-> In DynamoDB, tables, items and attributes are the core components 

# What is Primary Key
-> when you create a table, in addition to the table name, you must specificy the primary key of the table.
-> The primary key uniquely identifies each item in the table, so that no two item can have the same key

DynamoDB supports two different kinds of primary keys:
-> Partition key  -> if you want to maintain one column combination under primary key then you will use partition key
                        [To maintain the without duplicate]
-> Partition key and sort key  -> if you want to maintain two column combination under primary key then you will use partition key and sort key

# What is Index
-> We have two types of indexs in DynamoDB
  -> Local Secondary Index
  -> Global Secondary Index

# Local Secondary Index
-> Can be created only at the time of table creation
-> No Add or modify or removal option
-> Same Partition key as the Table
-> Differnet Sort key

# Global Secondary key
-> Can be created at table creation later
-> Different Partition and sort key
