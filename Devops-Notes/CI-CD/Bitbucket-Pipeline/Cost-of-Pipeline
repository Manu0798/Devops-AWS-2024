Below is a detailed cost estimation for Bitbucket Pipelines based on the provided pipeline configuration, along with free tier details. Bitbucket Pipelines pricing is based on build minutes and concurrency (parallel builds). The cost will vary depending on the usage, build duration, and the number of parallel builds.

Bitbucket Pipelines Pricing (as of October 2023)
1. Free Tier
Free Build Minutes: 50 minutes/month (for teams with up to 5 users).

Concurrency: 1 parallel build.

Storage: 1 GB of artifact storage.

Limitations:

Limited to small teams or personal projects.

Suitable for lightweight CI/CD pipelines with minimal build time.

2. Paid Plans
Bitbucket offers two paid plans for Pipelines:

Plan	Cost	Build Minutes	Concurrency	Artifact Storage
Standard	$3/user/month	2500 minutes	5	5 GB
Premium	$6/user/month	3500 minutes	10	10 GB
Additional Build Minutes: $10 per 1000 minutes (if you exceed the included minutes).

Additional Concurrency: $10 per additional parallel build.

Cost Estimation for Your Pipeline
Assumptions
Team Size: 5 users (small team).

Build Frequency: 50 builds/month.

Average Build Duration: 10 minutes/build.

Concurrency: 1 parallel build (default for Free Tier).

Artifact Storage: 500 MB/month (within Free Tier limits).

Calculations
Total Build Minutes: 50 builds × 10 minutes/build = 500 minutes/month.

Free Tier Usage: 50 minutes (Free Tier) + 450 minutes (additional usage).

When to Upgrade to a Paid Plan
Exceeding Free Tier Limits:

If your team exceeds 50 build minutes/month or needs more than 1 parallel build.

Larger Teams:

If your team has more than 5 users.

Advanced Features:

If you need more artifact storage, higher concurrency, or advanced security features.

Tips to Reduce Costs
Optimize Build Time:

Cache dependencies (e.g., node_modules) to reduce build time.

Parallelize steps where possible (e.g., run tests and security scans in parallel).

Use Free Tier Wisely:

Monitor build minutes and avoid unnecessary builds.

Choose the Right Plan:

Start with the Free Tier or Standard Plan and upgrade only if needed.

A self-hosted runner in Bitbucket Pipelines allows you to run builds on your own infrastructure instead of using Bitbucket's cloud-hosted runners, which can help reduce costs, especially for teams with heavy usage.

Cost Estimation for Self-Hosted Runner
Since you already have a GitHub self-hosted runner deployed on AWS EC2 (t3.large Reserved Instance) with 30GB EBS storage, we can reuse that infrastructure for a Bitbucket self-hosted runner as well.

1. AWS EC2 Cost (t3.large Reserved Instance)
Instance Type: t3.large (2 vCPUs, 8 GiB RAM)
Reserved Instance Cost: $29.88/month (1-year reserved, no upfront)
EBS Storage: 30GB gp3 SSD → $3.00/month
Data Transfer (Estimated 20GB outbound traffic): $3.20/month
Total AWS Cost: $36.08/month
2. Bitbucket Self-Hosted Runner Cost
Bitbucket does NOT charge extra for using self-hosted runners.
Cost Savings: You avoid paying for Bitbucket’s build minutes.
Drawback: You need to manage and maintain the runner yourself.
Cost Comparison: Bitbucket Cloud vs. Self-Hosted Runner
Option	Cost	Build Minutes	Concurrency	Maintenance
Free Tier (Cloud)	$4.50/month (after 50 free mins)	500	1	No maintenance
Standard Plan (Cloud)	$15/month	2500	5	No maintenance
Self-Hosted Runner (AWS)	$36.08/month	Unlimited	Unlimited	Requires maintenance
