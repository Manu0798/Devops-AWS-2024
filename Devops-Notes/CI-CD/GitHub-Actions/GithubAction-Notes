# What is GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions is a feature built into GitHub that lets you automate workflows like building, testing, and deploying code. Itâ€™s commonly used for CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment).


ðŸ§± Basic Concepts
1. Workflow
A set of instructions in a YAML file triggered by an event. Defined in .github/workflows/.

Example: .github/workflows/ci.yml

2. Events
Trigger the workflow. Common examples:
push
pull_request
workflow_dispatch (manual trigger)
schedule (cron)

3. Jobs
A workflow is made up of one or more jobs. Each job runs in its own runner.

4. Steps
A job has multiple steps. Each step runs a script or an action.

5. Runner
A GitHub-hosted or self-hosted VM where jobs run.


ðŸ§© Useful Marketplace Actions
GitHub has a Marketplace with 1000s of ready-to-use actions:
actions/checkout â€” Checks out your code
actions/setup-node â€” Set up Node.js
docker/build-push-action â€” Build and push Docker images
aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials â€” Set AWS credentials



# We have two types of runners in GitHub actions
-> self-hosted runners
-> GitHub-hosted runners



# What is the difference between Self-hosted runners and GitHub-hosted runners
-> Self-hosted runner: Self-hosted runners are machines (physical, virtual, or in a container) that you manage and maintain yourself. This means you have full control over the environment and software installed on these runners.
-> GitHub-hosted runners are convenient for most use cases, especially for open source projects or smaller teams that do not require specialized environments.

# Advantages of GitHub Actions over Jenkins
-> Hosting: Jenkins is self-hosted, meaning it requires its own server to run, while GitHub Actions is hosted by      GitHub and runs directly in your GitHub repository.
-> User interface: Jenkins has a complex and sophisticated user interface, while GitHub Actions has a more streamlined and user-friendly interface that is better suited for simple to moderate automation tasks.
-> Cost: Jenkins can be expensive to run and maintain, especially for organizations with large and complex automation needs. GitHub Actions, on the other hand, is free for open-source projects and has a tiered pricing model for private repositories, making it more accessible to smaller organizations and individual developers.
