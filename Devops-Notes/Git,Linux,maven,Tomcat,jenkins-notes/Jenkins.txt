-> After create the directory in slave you go to jenkins and click manage jenkins
-> Click magage nodes and clouds
-> Click New Node and give the somename and click permanent node and create
-> Number of executors means no of jobs do you want to run
-> Root directory means you have give that directoy path here  [/home/ec2-user/slave-1]
-> Give label name anything
-> Click Launch agent via SSH in Launch method
-> Give Public DNS of slave in Host place  [To get you have ec2 and click slave instance go to below it will appears]
-> Click credentionls and click SSH username with private key in Kind
-> Give username like ec2-user
-> Click Enter directly and paste your keypair there and click add
-> Select "manually Trusted Key verification Strategy" in host key strategy
-> You will leave the rest of the options and click apply and save
-> After complete the all above steps and you will create one in slave node
-> You create one freestyle job
-> Click Restrict where this porject can run in General
-> Click git and give URL and credentials in source code management
-> Go to build and click Invoke top-level maven target
-> It appears Maven Version and give maven goals [clean,package]

-> It appears credentials and Tomcat URL  [admin/*****, http://3.111.58.23:9090/]
-> Click Apply and save
-> click Build Now
-> [when node seeing offline then you have to click node and click bring back online later on you will execute]

# In Above we work on master and slave  
-> Now mostly used docker as a agent instaed of slave nodes in jenkins project setup because in terms of cost, efficiency and spining up and tearing the down the docker containers.

# How to follow the process
-> First you will create one ubuntu instance
-> you will install jenkins using below commands
sudo apt update
sudo apt install default-jdk
java -version
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jenkins
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
sudo systemctl status jenkins
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

-> Later you will install docker using below commands
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io
sudo su - 
usermod -aG docker jenkins
usermod -aG docker ubuntu
systemctl restart docker
exit and login agian
su - jenkins
run the sample docker file to check wheather docker is working or not

-> You should do the some configuration in jenkins to watch below github URL

# What is jenkins pipeline
-> jenkins pipeline is a automation solution that lets you create simple or complex pipeline
-> jenkins pipeline is a combination of plugins which automates number of tasks and makes the CI/CD pipeline efficient,
 high in quality and reliable.

# Jenkins provides two types of pipeline
1) Scripted pipeline [it starts with node]
2) Declarative pipeline [it starts with pipeline]

# What is jenkins file
-> jenkins file is nothing but a simple text file which is used to write jenkins pipeline 
 and automates the continuous integration process


# Do you want to deploy your files into sonar-qube
-> First you have to create one ec2 instance with 4gb RAM t2.medium and sonar name
-> you need install java before you install sonarqube (you will above java steps to install java)
-> sudo wget https://binaries.sonarsource.com/Distribution/sonarqube/sonarqube-8.9.2.46101.zip
-> sudo unzip sonarqube-8.9.2.46101.zip
-> sudo mv sonarqube-8.9.2.46101 /opt/
Note:- Sonar Qube server will not run with root user so that you have to create another user
-> sudo useradd sonar
-> sudo passwd sonar
-> sudo vim /etc/sudoers (or) sudo visudo
  sonar   ALL=(ALL)       ALL
-> cd /opt
-> sudo chown -R sonar:sonar sonarqube-8.9.2.46101
-> su sonar
-> cd /sonarqube-8.9.2.46101/bin/linux-x86-64            
-> sh sonar.sh start
-> cd /conf
-> vi sonar.properties (To see the sonarqube port number)
-> You have to some configuration to deploy the files into sonar-quebe
-> After Complete sonar-quebe install you will create token in sonar
-> later on you need to install sonarqube-scanner plugin in jenkins
-> you have to create credentials to sonaqube in jenkins
-> Go to manage jenkins and click credentials and click Global credentials in system
-> Click secret text in Kind
-> Paste the sonar token in Secret and give ID Description name
-> After complete the give credentials
-> Go to manege jenkins and click system configure and go to Sonarqube installations
-> Give name like Sonar-Server-7.8 and give sonarqube URL and click sonar token in credentials
-> After the Sonarqube installations. Go to manages jenkins and click Global Tool Configuration
-> Give name like this Sonar-Scanner-4.7 and click version SonarQube Scanner 4.7.0.2747
-> Click save and apply
-> After complete the sonarqube configuration in jenkins
-> You will create one pipeline job
-> Click pipelinejob and paste below code in pipeline

You will install maven in jenkins instance

# If you want to use pipeline script from SCM  [SCM source cource management]
-> You have to mainatain your pipeline script in git hib as one file
-> When you execute pipeline script job and you will Pipeline Script SCM in Pipeline
-> Then It will appear to you git hub URL and script path
-> You will give github URL and you need keep whichever name you have given to pipeline script in github  
-> You will give same in script path


# If you want to connect one manchine to another machine by using SSH [To connect the default to default]
First you will create one file with pemfile name in your teaminal and paste the data in that file 
chmod 400 fielname
ssh -i "filename" ec2-user@172.31.1.150 --> give publicIp

-> To connect with user to user
create two users in both instances
To give all root permissions to both users by using sudo vim /etc/sudoers
To give passwd authontication yes by using sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

ssh-keygen
ssh-copy-id jenkins@localhost [key download in local host so that first you need to connect local host
ssh-copy-id username@privateIp
ssh 'jenkins@172.31.1.150'



# If you want to install multiple git hub data and checkout data
 You need to install the SCM mulitle plugin
 You will click in multi SCM in source code in free style
 ADD SCM, add git data add the git multiple gits
 if you want to go sub-derictory checkout click add behaviors





# Jenkins details
-> General
	1) project parametrized  --> To get build job from different branches
	2) Restrict where this porject can run
-> Source Code managenment
	1) Git
-> Build Triggers
	1) Build perdically [It will build the job whichever time you want]
	2) POLL SCM [It will build the job whenever developer change code in github]
	3) Build after other projects are build
-> Build Environment
	1) Delete workspace before build starts
-> Build
	1) Invoke top-level maven target
-> Post-buils Actions
	1) Deploy war/ear to a container


# How to get custom plugin from jenkins
In Jenkins, if you need to use or manage custom plugins that are not available in the official Jenkins plugin repository, you can handle this in a few ways. Here's a guide on how to get and use custom plugins from outside the standard Jenkins plugin ecosystem:

1. Install a Plugin Manually
Step-by-Step:

Obtain the Plugin:

Download the .hpi or .jpi file for the custom plugin from the source where it's available. This might be a direct download link from a website, a GitHub repository, or another distribution method.
Upload the Plugin:

Go to your Jenkins instance.
Navigate to Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins.
Click on the Advanced tab.
Under Upload Plugin, click Choose File and select the .hpi or .jpi file you downloaded.
Click Upload.
Restart Jenkins:

After uploading the plugin, Jenkins typically requires a restart to activate the plugin. You can restart Jenkins from the Manage Jenkins page by selecting Reload Configuration from Disk, or you may need to restart the Jenkins service depending on your setup.

# Jenkins interview questions

# Explain the CI/CD pipeline implemention method
-> we used github as a source code and our taget is kuberntes in our CI/CD pipeline
-> we use jenkins orchestration for CI/CD. The reason we use jenkins is whenever user make commit changes in source code webhooks trigger the declarative pipeline then using declarative pipeline we run mulitple stages
-> Stage-1 [Checkout -> Clone the code from repository]
-> Stage-2 [Build -> Build the code using maven tool]
-> Stage-3 [code scaner -> Test the code using sonar-scanner]
-> Stage-4 [build the image -> Create the docker image]
-> Stage-5 [Push the image into dockerhub]
-> Stage-6 [Deploy the code into kuberntes]

# Why we are using declarative pipeline script
-> Scripted pipeline does not have more flexibility compare to declarative pipeline.
-> Using Declarative pipeline we can easily collaborate with people and everyone can easily understand

# How do you handle the issues if your worknode is down and not responce
-> I will log into the worker node and try to understand the problems.
-> I will try lookinto the worknode the health. In case CPU and RAM going out of limit or CPU and RAM full you will write python or shell script to send alert then you will take the immediate action and implement the autoscaling to that ec2 instances.

# There is developer who has commit the change in git repo how deos your jenkins notify ?
-> Using webhooks

# What type of agnet are you using in jenkins
-> Docker agent because it is light weight and dont need do lots of installization like maven and other tools which we require


# Explain the CI/CD pipeline implemention method
-> we used github as a source code and our taget is kuberntes in our CI/CD pipeline
-> we use jenkins orchestration for CI/CD. The reason we use jenkins is whenever user make commit changes in source code webhooks trigger the declarative pipeline then using declarative pipeline we run mulitple stages

Updated Stages in the Pipeline
Stage 1: Checkout
Action: Clone the code from the GitHub repository.
Details: Jenkins checks out the latest code, including the Dockerfile and Argo CD manifests.
Stage 2: Build
Action: Build the application code.
Details: Utilize Maven (or another build tool) to compile the code and execute unit tests for quality assurance.
Stage 3: Code Scanning
Action: Perform static code analysis using SonarQube.
Details: Identify bugs, code smells, and vulnerabilities to provide feedback for developers.
Stage 4: Dependency Check
Action: Run OWASP Dependency-Check.
Details: Analyze project dependencies for known vulnerabilities. This can be integrated as a Maven plugin or run as a standalone tool. The results will be stored for review.
Stage 5: Build the Docker Image
Action: Create a Docker image.
Details: Use the Dockerfile to build the image that packages the application and its dependencies.
Stage 6: Scan Docker Image with Trivy
Action: Scan the Docker image for vulnerabilities using Trivy.
Details: After building the Docker image, use Trivy to scan it for known vulnerabilities. Store the scan results and fail the pipeline if critical vulnerabilities are found.
Stage 7: Push the Docker Image
Action: Push the Docker image to a Docker registry.
Details: Tag and upload the image to a registry (e.g., Docker Hub) for deployment.
Stage 8: Update Argo CD
Action: Update the Argo CD application configuration.
Details: Trigger Argo CD to apply updated manifests, including updating the image tag in the Kubernetes deployment.
Stage 9: Deploy to Kubernetes
Action: Argo CD handles deployment.
Details: Automatically deploys the application by syncing the Kubernetes cluster with the desired state defined in the manifests.
Stage 10: Monitoring with Dynatrace
Action: Integrate Dynatrace for monitoring and observability.
Details: After deployment, Dynatrace tracks application performance and logs for insights into health and user experience.
