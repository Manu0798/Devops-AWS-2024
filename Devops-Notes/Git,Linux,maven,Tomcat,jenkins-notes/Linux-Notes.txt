# What is linux
-> Linux is open source operating system it is reliable and secure than other. It is developed by linus torvalds.
-> It was launched at sep 17 1991.

# What is the difference between Linux and windows
# Linux
-> you will installed linux with free license
-> In linux we have so many distributors. you can choose whichever you want
-> It is more secure than windows because viruses cant easily break the kernal

# Windows
-> You should purchase the license to install windows
-> Not many customization options available
-> We need powerful antiviruses software to overcome the viruses problems

# Why we are use linux
-> It is open source os
-> It is secure
-> Free download anywhere
-> low cost

# Where we can use linux
-> Mostly we used in portable devices (Audio system and navigation)
-> Car wipers
-> Artifical intellegence
-> Machine learing

# How linux will functioning
-> user
-> shell
-> kernel
-> hardware

When anyuser enter the command using keyboard it will interact with shell. shell will detected the wheather command is valid
or not if it is valid it will interact with kernal. kernal will translate into binary language then hard will understand the binary language
after understand the binary language it will return back the result to shell. shell will display the result.

-> Shell:- Shell is interputed command, interface between user and kernal
-> kernal:- It translate into binary language, interface between shell and hardware
-> Hardware: it will understand the binary language

# Types of shell
-> sh    -> shell
-> bash -> Born again shell
-> csh  -> C-shell
-> ksh  -> korn-shell

-> cat /etc/shells  -> To see the types of shells

# What is shell scripting
-> Shell is executable file it containg mulitple commands that are executed sequently.

# To open the files
-> head (To see the first 10 lines)
-> tail (To see the last 10 lines)
-> less (To see the line by line)
-> more (To see page by page)
-> cat (To create and open the file)
-> vi (To create and edit the file)

# File types
-> - (normal files)
-> d (directory files)
-> c (Charactor files)
-> b (Block files)
-> l (Link files)
-> s (symbolic file)

# What is the difference between Hard link and softlink
# HardLink
-> ln existingfile newfile [To creating the file]
-> Hard link having same inode numbers
-> Data will available after the remove the orginal file
-> It is not allowed for directory
-> comparitively faster 

# Softlink
-> ln -s existingfile newfile [To creating the file]
-> Soft link having different inode numbers
-> Data will not available after the remove the orginal file
-> It is allowed for directory
-> comparitively slow

# You will have another command to find the files
sudo yum install mlocate
after install you have to update your data base so that you have to execute below command to update database
sudo updatedb  --> To update database
locate filename  --> To find files
which echo  -->  It give the path of the command
# we have to use below command before use whatis
sudo mandb  --> To update database
whatis ls --> To see that command properties

# What is vim
-> vim stands for improved version of vi text editor
# vim modes
-> command mode ( When we open the vi editor it will be command mode)
-> insert mode  (When we press the i it will goes to the insert mode)
-> visual mode  (After esc the insert mode it will be visual mode)

# command mode
-> A -> It will place the cursor end of the sentence
-> I -> It will place the cursor staring of the sentence
-> o -> It will get the space below the sentences
-> O -> It will get the space above sentences
-> a -> It will shift the cursor from one letter to another letter
-> gg -> It will place the cursor staring of the line
-> G -> It will place the cursor end of the line
-> w -> It will shift the cursor word by word inforword direction
-> U -> It will remove the entire line
-> yy -> Copy the line but be cursor before the line

# Insert mode
-> i  -> Insert 

# Command line mode

-> :4 -> it will place the cursor at 4th place
-> :X -> To set the password to the file
-> :X enter, enter -> To remove the passoword to the file

# Visual mode
-> To see the data


# User Management
-> We have three type of user in linux
-> root user -> It default start from 0
-> System user -> It default start from 1 to 499
-> Normal user -> It start from 500 to 60000

# What are the properties in user
1) username  2) password 3) UID 4) GID 5) comments  6) directory 7) shell
UID -> it having only one user (user ID)
GI -> It having collection people (group ID)
-> root and system user it will come defaultly like above format
-> normal user
1) manoj  2) password  3) 500-60000 4) 500-60000 5) somewriting 6) /home 7) bin/bash

-> cat /etc/group  --> To see the groups
-> sudo cat /etc/gshadow  --> To see the group passwd

# We have two types of groups 
-> primary group
-> secondary group

-> Primary group: Primary group will add automatically when we create the user                
-> Secondary group: Secondary group will not add automatically when we create the user. We should create seperately
-> we can assign 16 groups to user in linux. ptimary group would be within 16 groups. we can assign 15 groups to the user

# Permissions to the files and directories
-> sudo chmod 775 filename  --> To give permission to the files
read permission=4
write permission=2
execute permission=1
no permission=0

-> sudo chmof o-t filename  --> To remove the stcky bit permission to the file

file having 666 permission and directory having 777 permission 
umask value is 022  (umask 022 it will come defaultly)
defaulty file will come 644 permission and directory will come 755 permission to add mask value

umask newvalue
umask 023

# umask permanent change

-> setfacl -x u:username:rwx filename  -> To delete the user acl permission to file
-> setfacl -x g:groupname:rwx filename  -> To delete the group acl permission to file
-> setfacl -b filename  -> To remove the all permission

# Booting Process
-> Bios
-> MBR
-> Grab
-> Kernal
-> init
-> Run levels

-> When we power on the system that all the devices is called Bios post process
-> Then we called Bios. Bios stands for Basic input output system here choose "Root disk"
-> Then we called MBR. MBR stands for master boot record it is located to "first sector on disk"
-> Then we called Grab. Grab stands for ground unified boot it is located to /boot/grab/grab.conf
-> Then we called kernal. kernal loads the all kernal modules on kernel will execute the init process
-> init process goes to the /etc/initlab  [To change the init process to permentaly vi /etc/initlab]
-> Here choose the runlevels based on Runlevels

# Runlevels
-> How to check the run level
 who -R [To check the run level]
-> Total run levels '6'
1) init 0 -> Shutdown
2) init 1 -> single user
3) init 2 -> mulituser without NFS
4) init 3 -> mulituser with NFS and CLI
5) init 4 -> reserved
6) init 5 -> mulituser with NFS and GUI
7) init 6 -> reboot 

# uname
-> uname -s -> To see all kernal name
-> uname -n -> To see host name
-> uname -r -> To see the kernal version
-> uname -v -> To see released date
-> uname -m -> To see the mission code
-> uname -p -> To see the processer code
-> uname -o -> To see the operating system
-> uname -n -> To see the hostaname
