# What is kubernetes Statefulset
-> A StatefulSet is a Kubernetes workload API object used to manage stateful applications — that is, applications that require:
-> Stable, unique network identities
-> Stable storage (persistent volumes)
-> Ordered deployment, scaling, and deletion


🔁 Difference Between StatefulSet and Deployment

| Feature          | Deployment                 | StatefulSet                            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Pod Name         | Random (`pod-xyz-abc`)     | Stable and predictable (`pod-name-0`)  |
| Storage          | Shared or Ephemeral        | Stable and Persistent (via PVCs)       |
| Pod Identity     | Not guaranteed             | Stable network identity (`pod-name-0`) |
| Start/Stop Order | Not guaranteed             | Ordered start/stop                     |
| Use Case         | Stateless apps (e.g., web) | Stateful apps (e.g., databases)        |


🧠 Key Features of StatefulSet
Stable Pod Names:
Pods are created with predictable names like:
mysql-0, mysql-1, mysql-2

Stable Storage:
Each pod gets its own PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC), and that volume sticks even if the pod is deleted or rescheduled.

Ordered Deployment & Scaling:
Pods are created, updated, and deleted one at a time in a defined order.

Sticky Identity:
The pod’s DNS and storage identity does not change across restarts.




🧪 Real-World Example: MongoDB StatefulSet on AWS (with EBS)

1. StorageClass for EBS

apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: ebs-sc
provisioner: kubernetes.io/aws-ebs
parameters:
  type: gp3
  fsType: ext4
reclaimPolicy: Retain
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer


2. Headless Service

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mongo
spec:
  clusterIP: None  # headless
  selector:
    app: mongo
  ports:
  - port: 27017
    targetPort: 27017

🔹 Headless service (clusterIP: None) is needed so each pod gets a stable DNS name, e.g., mongo-0.mongo.default.svc.cluster.local

3. StatefulSet for MongoDB

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: mongo
spec:
  serviceName: "mongo"
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mongo
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mongo
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mongo
        image: mongo:4.4
        ports:
        - containerPort: 27017
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mongo-data
          mountPath: /data/db
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: mongo-data
    spec:
      accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
      storageClassName: ebs-sc
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 10Gi


Note:
✅ Correct! When using a StorageClass with a StatefulSet in Kubernetes, you do NOT need to manually create PV or PVC.

🔄 Here's why:
The volumeClaimTemplates section in the StatefulSet automatically creates a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) for each pod.

The PVC is dynamically provisioned using the specified StorageClass, which in turn creates the PersistentVolume (PV) using your cloud provider’s backend (like AWS EBS).

kubectl apply -f storageclass.yaml
kubectl apply -f mongo-headless-svc.yaml
kubectl apply -f mongo-statefulset.yaml





# Extract Data
what are the difference between stateful and deployment
statefulset
-> When we delete the pod in statefulset then another pod will create on same name
-> we need persistance volume and persistance volumeclaim to create the statefulset
Deployment
-> When we delete the pod in statefulset then another pod will create with another name
-> Persistance volume and persistance volumeclaim It doesnt mandatory to create the statefulset

Statefulset-Data Replication
Data Replication: Since each pod in the statefulset has its own pv and pvc, data replication can be handled
 at the storage level
How to work with statefulset
-> You have to execute the service.yml
-> You have to execute the configmap.yml
-> You have to execute the secret.yml
-> You have to execute the persistence,volume.yml
-> After execute the all above file later you have to execute the statefulset
