# What is kubernetes
-> k8s is an container orchestration platform
-> k8s is an opensource software
-> k8s is manage the docker container
-> k8s will take care of container deployment, scalling, descalling and container load balancer
-> k8s is not replacemt of docker
-> k8s is replacement of docker-swarm
-> k8s is developed by google and donted CNCF in 2014 
    [CNCF means cloud native computing foundation]
-> k8s software developed by using Go langauge
-> k8s version relased to market in the year of 2015
-> K8s script write in json format
-> k8s works on clouste mudules

# Why we are using K8S
-> Kubernetes is a powerful open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
-> To achive the below features we will use k8s
  -> Auto Scheduling
  -> Self healing capacity
  -> Rollout and Rollback
  -> Auto scalling
  -> Service discovery
  -> Storage orchestration
  -> Secret and configuration management

# What is Docker-swaram
-> Docker Swarm is a container orchestration tool for clustering and scheduling Docker containers.

# What is the difference between Docker-swaram and kubernets
# Docker swarm
-> Easy to start the cluster
-> Manual Autoscaling
-> Need third party tool to monitor like ELK
-> Auto setup of load balancer
-> No expernice with production deployment 
-> Docker swarm is better suited for small organisation

# Kubernetes
-> Difficult to start the cluster
-> Automatic autoscaling
-> Intergrated tool
-> Manual setup of load balancer
-> expernice with production deployment 
-> Kubernetes is better suited for large organisation

# What are the features of K8S
-> Auto Scheduling
-> Self healing capacity  [Replication controller]
-> Rollout and Rollback  [Deployment]
-> Auto scalling
-> Service discovery
-> Storage orchestration
-> Secret and configuration management

# What is Auto Scheduling
-> Kubernets will provide the advance schedular option to launch the containers based on your reruirment

# What is Self healing capacity
-> If a containerized app or an application component fails or goes down. Kuberneted re-deploy it to retain the desired state

# Rollout and Rollback
-> If something goes wrong, kubernets will rollback the change for you

# Auto scalling
-> Autoscaling allow you to automatically scale up and scale down your application based on cpu utilization and memory utilization
    Note: Docker-swarm load balancing is manual process
          kubernets supports autoscaling load balancer
# Service Discovery
-> Kubernets will take care the every thing about network.

# Storage orchestration
-> Kubernets will automatically mount the storage

# Secret and configuration management
-> Depoly and update secrets are not exposing in your stack configuration

# Kubernets Architecture
-> k8s works on cluster modules
-> In k8s cluster we will have masternode and workernode

# To Communicate with kubernets cluster we have 2 options
-> UI (user interface)
-> Kubectl (CLI S/w)

# What is Kubectl
-> Kubectl is command line interface(CLI) for interacting with Kubernetes clusters
-> Kubectl is used to run the commands on kubernetes cluster

# How many nodes in k8s
-> We have two nodes in k8s 
   -> Master Node  [Master node will manage the worker node in cluster]
   -> Worker node  [Worker will run the tasks assign by master node]

# What are the components in master node
-> API
-> ETCD
-> Scheduler
-> Control manager

# What is API 
-> API server will act as communicator between develop/Devops and K8s componets

# What is ETCD
-> It act as database in k8s
-> ETCD will stores cluster information such it current state, desitred state, configuration resources and runtime data.
-> Whenever we run k8s application that request goes to the API Server and API server will store the request in ETCD.

# What Schedular
-> It will scheduled the pods for execution which are unschedule in ETCD
-> Schedular will schedule the pods to workernode with the help of Kubelet

# What is Control manager
-> The Controller Manager monitors the current state of your cluster through the API Server and makes appropriate changes to keep the application running by ensuring sufficient Pods are in a healthy state.

# What are the components in worker node
-> kubelet
-> container runtime [docker]
-> kubeproxy [Network proxy]
-> Pods

# What is kubelet
-> Kubelet will act as a node-agent 
-> kubelet ensure the containers are running healthy in pod 
-> kubelt will interact with container runntime to create the container

# What is container runtime
-> It is responsible for managing the execution and lifecycle of containers within the Kubernetes environment.

# What is kube-proxy
-> kube proxy act as network proxy
-> Kube proxy will maintain network rules on pods
-> The network rules allow the network to communicate your pods from inside and outside of the cluster

# What is Pod
-> Pod is small execution unit in K8s
-> Pod having group of containers
-> Containers will grouped as a pod in order to increase the intelligence of resources
-> Pod will run single container and multi container.

# What is Namespace
-> In Kubernetes, a namespace is a virtual cluster within a Kubernetes cluster. 
-> It is used to organize and scope resources within the cluster, providing a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users, teams, or projects. 
-> Namespaces are primarily used to create isolated environments and prevent resource conflicts between different applications or users.
-> kubernets components will be grouped logically using namespaces
Note: we can consider namespace as a java package
-> we will get 3 namespaces when we setup the kubernets cluster
1) default -> It doesnt specify any namespace
2) Kube-system -> It contains K8S Control panal Components
3) Kube-public  -> It is reserved for k8S system usage

# How types of pods can you create
-> We can create two types
-> Interactive apporoach
       In interactive approach we can create pod using command
        kubectl run --name conatinername --images=ashokit/javawebapplication
-> Declarative apporoach
      Declarative Approach means we will create the pod using manifest file(yml)
	apiVersion -> It represents the version
	kind -> What is the purpose of the manifeast file 
	metadata -> It represents the lables
	spec -> What do you want to use this manifeast file
	filename default is .yml

# How many service in Kubernetes
-> Cluster IP 
-> Nodeport
-> Load Balancer
-> ExternalName Service
-> Headless Service

# What is Cluster IP
-> If we use Cluster Ip Services we can access the pod inside of the cluster
    curl serviceip:portnumber

# What is Nodeport
-> If we use Nodeport service we can access the pod inside and outside of the cluster by using node Ip address
   [Port number range in K8S is 30000 to 32767]

# What is load balancer
-> If we use Load balancer service we can access the pod inside and outside of the cluster by using load balancer URL

# What is the difference between NodePort and Load Balancer
NodePort exposes a service on a static port on each node's IP, allowing external access to the service, while LoadBalancer automatically provisions an external load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple nodes or pods, providing a more robust and scalable solution for external access.

# What is ExternalName Service
-> If we use ExternalName Service we can access the pod outside of the cluster by using DNS name

# What is Headless Service
-> This type service is used when you dont need single, stable Ip address for access the service.
-> It returns the IP address of individual pods backing the service insted of single cluster Ip.

# What are the difference between pod manifest file and service manifest file
-> Pod manifest file having lables
-> service manifest file having selectors

# What is Replication Controller [Self Healing capabilities]
-> It is one of key feature in k8s
-> We can scale up and scale down the pods using replication controller
-> We can create the mulitple pods
-> We can achive high availablity using replication controller
   Note:High avaliablity means always our application should be accessable

# What is Replication Set
-> It is next generation of Replication controller
-> We can scale up and scale down the pods using replication controller
-> We can create the mulitple pods
-> We can achive high availablity using replication controller
   Note:High avaliablity means always our application should be accessable

# What is the difference between Replication Controller and Replication set
-> Selectors is the difference between Replication Controller and Replication set
-> We have two types of selector 
   -> Equality selector
   -> Set based selector
# What is Equality Selector
-> Equality Selecotr give the single selector
-> Replication controller supports Equality selector

# What is Set-based selector
-> Set-based Selecotr give the mulitple selector
-> Replication set supports Equality selector


# What is deployment
-> By using deployment we can rollout and rollback our application deployment
-> we can achive the auto-scalling by deployment

# How many types of deployment strategies
-> Recreate deployment strategy
-> Rolling deployment strategy
-> Blue and green apporach [It is not a strategy it is a approach]
-> Canary Deployment
-> A/B Testing
-> Shadow Deployment
-> Staggered Deployment
-> Rollback Deployment

# What is the Recreate deployment strategy
-> When we using the recreate deployment strategy existing pods will delete and pods will create.

# What is the Rolling depolyment strategy
-> When we using the rolling deployment strategy exsting pods will delete one by one while new pods will create one by one.

# What is Blue and Green deployment strategy
-> When we using blue and green deployment strategy we can deploy our application with zero down time.
-> A blue/green deployment is a deployment strategy in which you create two separate, but identical environments.
-> One environment (blue) is running the current application version and one environment (green) is running the new application version.

# Advantages of Blue and green approach
-> Rapid releasing
-> Simple rollbacks
-> Built-in-disaster-recovery
-> Seamless cutomer experience
-> Zero Down time

# What Canary Deployment
-> Introduce a new version of the application to a subset of users or traffic gradually. 
-> Monitor for issues and progressively increase the rollout if everything goes well, or roll back the changes if issues are detected.

# What is Autoscaling
> Auto Scalling allow to you to automatically scale up and scale down your application based CPU Utilization and Memory Utilization
-> We have two types of auto scalling
  1) Horizontial scalling
  2) Vertical scalling

-> Horizontial Scalling increase the number of instances based CPU Utilization and Memory Utilization when increase the load on servers
-> Vertical Scalling increase the capacity of system means increase the CPU and Memory size when increase the load on servers but it need to do restart it will affect somedown time it is stateless nature


# What is Helm
-> Helm is a package manager for K8S application
-> Helm allows you to install or deploy application on K8S cluster in a smillar mannaer to yum/apt for linux system

# What is Prometheus [ It is a monitoring tool]
-> Prometheus is an open-source system monitoring and alerting toolkit.
-> Prometheus collect and store its metrics as time series data
-> Prometheus out-of-the box monitoring capabilities for the K8S container orchestration platform
 
Note:Prometheus will collect the data and Prometheus will give the data to grafana and grafana analysis the data and
   generate the charts and graphs for users

# What is Grafana [It is a visulation tool]
-> Grafana is database analysis and monitoring tool
-> Grafana is multiplatform open source analytics and interactive visualiization web application
-> Grafana will connect with prometheus with data source 

# What is ELK Stack [To monitor the application logs]
-> The ELK stack is a collection of three open-source
   E: Elastic Search -> For store the logs
   L: Log stash -> Enchances the data and sent to the Elastic search
   K: Kibana -> It display the data stored in elastic search [Kibana is a monitoring tool for logs]
-> It allows you search the all logs in single place

# What is config
-> Config is used to store the config data conusmed by pods and other resourece in cluster

# What is Secret
-> Secret is used to store the senities data like username and password

# What are the types of secrets
-> Opaque -> the most common type of secret. It allows you store the keyvalue pairs
-> Docker-Registry -> used fot storing credientionls to authenciate with private Docker Registry
-> TLS -> It is used to store the TLS certification
-> Service Account -> Automatically created the secrets that provide the credientials for accessing kubernetes API

# What is compute resource
-> CPU and memory we called compute resources

# What is CPU and Memory
# CPU
-> Measured a fraction of time
-> Ex=200m(0.2cpu), 1cpu(1000m)
-> Compressible
-> Throttles means it wont kill even through we cross the CPU limit because it is Compressible
-> 1 CPU is equal to
      1 vCPU in AWS
      1 core in GCP
      1 vcore in azure
      1 Hyperthread on bare-metal

# Memory
-> Measured on bytes
-> Ex=1KB (1000 bytes), 1KiB (1024 bytes)
-> Ex=1MB (1000 kb), 1MiB (1024 kib)
-> Not compressible
-> Terminates


-> We have two options in resources 
  1. requersts  [it will schedule the pods in nodes based on how much CPU and memory you have mentioned in requersts if node does not have that CPU and memory it wont schedule the pods]
  2. limits    [Your container can use only that amount of CPU and memory which you mention in limits]

# What is CRD
-> CRD Stands for Custom resource Definition
-> CRDs allow users to create new types of resources without adding another API server.
-> When you create a new CustomResourceDefinition (CRD), the Kubernetes API Server creates a new RESTful resource path for each version you specify. 


# What is Daemon Set
-> Daemon set in kubernets lets you run pods in all the nodes
-> We will create the daemon set for log collections, monitoring and storage

# What is the difference betwenn regular deploymnent and Daemonset
-> Deployment means:- When we deploy the pod in kubernets pods will run the in nodes based on replica. If new node create in cluster pod wont add in that node.
-> DaemonSet means:- When we deploy the pod in kubernets pods will run in all the nodes. If new node create in cluster pod will add automatically in that new node.


# What is ingress
-> Ingress is an API object that provides external access to service within cluster.
-> It acts as a layer 7 (application layer) load balancer, allowing external traffic to be routed to different services based on HTTP/HTTPS routes and rules


# what is the difference between job and cronjob in kubernetes
While Jobs are designed for running one-time or on-demand tasks, CronJobs are used for executing tasks at regular intervals


# What is network policy in k8s
-> Network Policies are a feature that allows you to control the traffic flow between different pods and services within your cluster. 
-> They provide a way to specify how groups of pods are allowed to communicate with each other and with other network endpoints.
-> Pods become isolated by using network policy

# How many types of network policies
-> We have two types of network policies
   -> Ingress network policy
   -> Egress network policy

# What is Ingress network policy  [It works like a inbound rule]
-> Ingress is a API object that helps developers expose their application and manage external access by providing https routing rules to the service within cluster.

# What is Egress network policy  [It works like a outbound rule]
-> Egress refers to the process of traffic leaving the kubernets cluster and going to an external destination.


# What is RBAC
-> RBAC is the way to define the different level of permission or access level for different users based on rules
-> RBAC is the heart of kubernetes security
-> RBAC is a key security control to ensure that cluster users and workloads have only the access to resources required to 
   execute their roles.
-> We have two types of roles
  1. ROle:- Role is work on specific namespace
  2. Cluster Role:- Cluster role is work on cluster level means it work on all the namespaces



# What is volumes in Kubernets
A volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod, not the individual containers. This means if a container crashes and is restarted, the volume will still retain its data.

# Types of Volumes:
Kubernetes supports various types of volumes, each with its own use cases, including:
-> emptyDir: A temporary directory that shares storage among containers in a pod.
-> hostPath: Mounts a file or directory from the host node’s filesystem into a pod.
-> persistentVolumeClaim (PVC): A request for storage that dynamically provisions a persistent volume (PV) from a storage class.
-> nfs, awsElasticBlockStore, gcePersistentDisk, etc.: Integrate with external storage systems.

# What emptydir
-> When we use the emptydir volume type even if we restart and delete the pod we will lose the data assositate with pod.
-> We cant persistence and share data to multiple nodes    not recommand

# What hostpath
-> When we use the hostpath volume type even if we restart and delete the pod we will retrive the data assositate with pod. [means data will store in node whereever pod is running]
-> We cant persistence and share data to multiple nodes [It will save data in single node if that node will delete we will lose the data]  not recommand

Note: So far we dicussed above volume are ephemeral because if pod or nodes gets deleted or restared the data assosiate with pods those volumes gets deleted.

# What Persistene volumes
-> When we use the PVC volume type even if we restart and delete the pod we will retrive the data assositate with pod. [means data will store in node whereever pod is running]
-> We can persistence and share data to multiple nodes   [It will save data in multiple node if that node will delete we will retrive the data from another node]  recommand


# Kuberbets offers three components to persistence the data
-> Persistence volumes
-> Persistence volume claims
-> Storage class

# What is Persistence volumes(PV)
-> A PersistentVolume is a piece of storage in the Kubernetes cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using stoage class

# What is Persistence volume claims
-> A PersistentVolumeClaim is a request for storage by a user or developer.
-> It is a resource object in the Kubernetes API that allows a Pod to access a piece of storage from a PersistentVolume (PV).

# In persistence volume claim we have different access modes
-> ReadWriteMany   -> Which means this volume can be mounted as read write by many nodes  [If you are running in different node this is best option for you]
-> ReadWriteOnce   -> Which means all your pods are running in single node This is the best option [But you are pods running in different nodes they cant use this volumes
-> ReadOnlyOnce   ->  when use both ReadOnlyOnc and ReadOnlyMany you cant write the data in persistence volumes [it is just read only mode]
-> ReadOnlyMany   -> 
-> ReadWriteOncePod  -> When we use this access mode this volume can be mounted as read write once by single pod [ we will this mode to ensure only one pod accross the whole cluster can read or write]

# What is storage class 
-> How the pvs should be created dynamically

# Persistence  Volumes we can create two ways 
-> EBS will support only ReadWriteOnce   
-> EFS will support only ReadWriteMany 

# What is the difference Between EBS and EFS
-> EBS will support only ReadWriteOnce means EBS volume can be mounted by single pod on one node at a time 
-> EFS will support only ReadWriteMany means EFS volume can be mounted by multiple pods across multiple nodes simultaneously

# Why Use Volumes?
-> Data Persistence: Store data that needs to persist beyond the lifecycle of a pod.
-> Shared Storage: Enable multiple containers within a pod to share data.
-> Decoupling Storage from Pods: Manage storage independently from the pod lifecycle, making it easier to handle data.


# What is kubernetes Statefulset
-> StatefulSet is the workload API object used to manage stateful applications.
-> StatefulSets are particularly useful for applications that require unique network identifiers, stable storage, and ordered deployment and scaling.
-> When you delete the pod in statefulset then it will delete the whichever pod cretead latestly
-> If you want to host the database in kubernetes then you will use statefulset
-> We have to give clusterIP to statefulset because we cant expose our database to everyone

# What are the difference between stateful and deployment
statefulset
-> When we delete the pod in statefulset then another pod will create on same name
-> we need persistance volume and persistance volumeclaim to create the statefulset
Deployment
-> When we delete the pod in statefulset then another pod will create with another name
-> Persistance volume and persistance volumeclaim It doesnt mandatory to create the statefulset

# What is Calico network 
-> Calico implements the Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) as a plug-in and provides agents for Kubernetes to provide networking for containers and pods.

# How does two conatier can communicate in single node
-> Two Container can communicate easily inside the pod using local host and port 

# How Does it happen to communicate two container inside the pod
-> Kubernets will use the pause container for sharing the network within the container in the same pod


# How Pod-to-Pod Communication within the Same Node
-> Each pod in Kubernetes gets its own unique IP address within the cluster, even if it’s running on the same node as 
   another pod. This allows pods to communicate directly with each other using these IP addresses, without any need for port 
   forwarding or special routing.
-> If a pod in Node A needs to communicate with another pod (on the same node), it can directly use the IP of the other pod. 
   The Kubernetes network model ensures that pods on the same node can communicate directly via their IP addresses.
   Note: Pods on the same node can communicate directly via IP addresses or DNS names.

# How Pod-to-Pod Communication across Nodes
-> Each pod in Kubernetes is assigned a unique IP address. This IP is unique within the cluster, regardless of whether the 
   pod is on the same node as another pod or on a different node.
-> This unique IP addressing allows pods to communicate with each other using their IPs, even across nodes.
-> When a pod on Node-A wants to communicate with a pod on Node-B, the traffic is routed through the Kubernetes network 
   (using the CNI plugin) such as Calico, Flannel, or Cilium. 

# How to describe the kubernetes security
-> Enable Role-Based-Access-Contro;
-> Use Third party authentication for API server
-> Protect ETCD with TLS and Firewall
-> Isolate the kubernetes nodes
-> Monitor network traffic to limit communications
-> Use process whitelsting
-> Turn on Audit logging
-> Keep kubernets version up and Date
-> Lock Down Kubelet
-> Secure kubernetes with Aqua


# Scenario based questions
# What is the difference between docker and kubernetes?

# What are the main components of kubernetes architecture?

# What is the difference between Docker swaram and kubernetes?

# What is the difference between Docker container and kubernetes pod?
a Docker container is an isolated environment for running a single application, while a Kubernetes pod is a higher-level abstraction that allows one or more containers to run together and be managed by Kubernetes.

# What is Namaspece in Kubernets

# What is the role of Kube-proxy

# What are the different types of services within kubernetes

# What is the difference between NodePort and Loadbalancer

# What is the role of kubelet

# How do you handle the Kubernetes cluster Security
-> RBAC
-> By default Pod can communicate with any another pods. we can set up the network policies to limit this communication 
   between pods
-> Use namespace for multi tenancy
-> Turn on audit logs


# What is Service Mesh [If anyone ask i know how it will work but i don't work on particully 
-> Service mesh is used for to communicate from one service to another service securaly
-> Servie mesh is used for running east-west tarffic in cluster
-> Enabling the mutual TLS
-> Service mesh provides the some capabilities such as load balance, observability, tarcing, authentication and 
   authorization etc

# What is init container and why do we need it
-> Init container are the container that should run and complete befor the startup the main container in the pod
-> It provides the separate lifecycle for the initialization so that it enables the separation of concens in the application

# What Pod Disruption Budget
-> Pod disruption budget handles the voluntary disruption 
-> Pod disruption budget specisy the number replicas that an application can tolerate.
	you have deployment manifeast with 5 replica. you have deployed but PDB allow the only 4 at a time then it eviction API allow the voluntary disruption of one pod at a time.

# What is Pod security policy in kubernetes
A **Pod Security Policy (PSP)** in Kubernetes is a cluster-level resource that defines security rules to control the behavior and configuration of pods, enforcing security best practices.
