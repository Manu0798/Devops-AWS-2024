# what is deployment 
-> By using deployment we can rollout and rollback our application deployment
-> we can achive the auto-scalling by deployment
-> Deployment is used to tell kubernets how to create and or modify the instaces of pods

# What are Deployment Strategies in Kubernets
-> Recreate deployment strategy
-> Rolling deployment strategy
-> Blue and green apporach [It is not a strategy it is a approach]
-> Canary Deployment
-> A/B Testing
-> Shadow Deployment
-> Staggered Deployment
-> Rollback Deployment

# What is Recreate deployment strategy
When we use recrete deployment strategy existing pods will delete and new will create

# What is Rolling deployment strategy
When we use the rolling deployment strategy pod will delete one by one while pod will create one by one 


# What is blue and green approach
-> If you want to deploy your application with Zero down time. you will follw blue and green apporach
-> A blue/green deployment is a deployment strategy in which you create two separate, but identical environments.
-> One environment (blue) is running the current application version and one environment (green) is running the new application version.
-> Blue and green deployment is an application release model
-> It reduces the risk and minimizes the down time
-> It uses two production env
  1) Blue Env  -> Blue Env is a Old Version
  2) Green Env -> Green Env is a New Version

Advantages of Blue and green approach
1) Rapid releasing
2) Simple rollbacks
3) Built-in-disaster-recovery
4) Seamless cutomer experience
5) Zero Down time

Running Notes
-> Live code is running in Blue env 
-> First we need deploy in green env after code tested in green env then traffic will divert into blue env

Note: what are the difference Prod Env and Preprod or Nonpod Env
Prod Env means nothing but a live code
None Prod ENV are used for application testing like Dev,Sit,UAT env
-> Dev:- Devlopers will use Dev env for integration testing
-> SIT will use by software testing team to test our application
-> UAT will use by client to test the code
-> Pilot env is called pre-prod environment
-> Prod env will be available for public access or live code

# How to do Blue and Green Deployment
-> First you will deploy the bluedeployment.yml [old code] [live code]
-> After that you will deploy the blueservice.yml
-> later on you will access the application in browser with instance public Ip and service portnumber
-> later on you will deploy the greendeployment.yml [you will test the code before deploy the live code]
-> later on you will deploy the greenservice.yml
-> later on you will access the application in browser with instance public Ip and service portnumber
-> Green env is woking good after the deployment. 
-> lateron you go to the blueservice.yml file and change the file selecters with greenservice.yml file selectors
-> After change you will access the browser blueservice.yml file with port number.

-> kubectl get deployment  --> To see the deployments
-> kubectl delete deployment <deploymentname>  --> To delete the deployment

Note: When we delete the deployment pod will delete the automatically but service wouldnt delete

# What is Canary Deployment
-> Introduce a new version of the application to a subset of users or traffic gradually. 
-> Monitor for issues and progressively increase the rollout if everything goes well, or roll back the changes if issues are detected.


Note: Bule, green and canary  wont support the outof box so that we should setup the ingress controller.
