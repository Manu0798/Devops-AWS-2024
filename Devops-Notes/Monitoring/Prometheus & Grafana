# What is Prometheus [ It is a monitoring tool]
-> Prometheus is an open-source system monitoring and alerting toolkit.
-> Prometheus collect and store its metrics as time series data
-> Prometheus out-of-the box monitoring capabilities for the K8S container orchestration platform
 
Note:Prometheus will collect the data and Prometheus will give the data to grafana and grafana analysis the data and
   generate the charts and graphs for users

# What is Grafana [It is a visulation tool]
-> Grafana is database analysis and monitoring tool
-> Grafana is multiplatform open source analytics and interactive visualiization web application
-> Grafana will connect with prometheus with data source 

# In prometheus we have two exporters 
-> Node Exporter  --> It is used for collect the metrics from server
-> Blackbox Exporter  --> It is used for collect the metrics from application


# How to install Prometheus 
-> Go to this https://prometheus.io/download/
-> After we have to install node exporter for monitoring the server
-> you will find node export link if you scroll down 
-> wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.9.0/node_exporter-1.9.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
-> tar -xvf node_exporter-1.9.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
-> rm node_exporter-1.9.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
-> cd node_exporter-1.9.0.linux-amd64/
-> ./node_exporter
-> After start the node exporter, you will copy in web browser along with ip and port number, default port is 9100
-> If you want to run in backgroung  
-> ./node_exporter &

-> You will install blackbox for monitoring the application
-> wget https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter/releases/download/v0.26.0/blackbox_exporter-0.26.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
-> tar -xvf blackbox_exporter-0.26.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
-> rm blackbox_exporter-0.26.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
-> cd blackbox_exporter-0.26.0.linux-amd64/
-> ./blackbox_exporter
-> -> After start the blackbox_exporter, you will copy in web browser along with ip and port number, default port is 9115

-> you will install prometheus
-> you will find below prometheus link in prometheus offical website
-> wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v3.2.1/prometheus-3.2.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
-> tar -xvf prometheus-3.2.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
-> rm prometheus-3.2.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
-> cd prometheus-3.2.1.linux-amd64/
-> vi prometheus.yml
-> Delete the existing data and copy below data to modify the node_exporter and black box exporter ips and portnumber
-> If you not understand to setup this you will watch video in below link

-> ./prometheus
-> After start the prometheus, you will copy in web browser along with ip and port number, default port is 9090
-> Click on status and select target

-> After setup prometheus you will grafana for visulation to create charts, graphs
-> Install grafana 
-> https://grafana.com/grafana/download
-> sudo apt-get install -y adduser libfontconfig1 musl
-> wget https://dl.grafana.com/enterprise/release/grafana-enterprise_11.5.2_amd64.deb
-> sudo dpkg -i grafana-enterprise_11.5.2_amd64.deb
-> sudo /bin/systemctl daemon-reload
-> sudo /bin/systemctl enable grafana-server
-> sudo /bin/systemctl start grafana-server
-> After that copy the ip paste it in web browser along with port number 3000 
-> Later click on connection, search the prometheus, click add new database, copy the prometheus URL and click save and test
-> Later you will import the dash board for that use below links for node exporter dash board
-> search node exporter grafana dashboard, click first one
-> https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/1860-node-exporter-full/
-> Copy the id
-> Go to the grafana, click dashboard, clikc new, choose import, paste id, click load, choose prometheus database, click import
-> Later you will add the blackbox dashboard, go to browser search blackbox exporter grafana dashboard
-> https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/7587-prometheus-blackbox-exporter/
-> Copy the id
-> Go to the grafana, click dashboard, clikc new, choose import, paste id, click load, choose prometheus database, click import
