1. DNS Response Time (ms)
What it is:
How much Time taken to translate the domain name (e.g., example.com) into its IP address.

Example:
The user types https://example.com in the browser. The system checks which IP address corresponds to example.com.

If this takes 11 ms, then DNS Response Time = 11 ms.

🛎️ Alert Example:

⚠️ Alert: DNS Response Time exceeds 100 ms from location: Bengaluru
❗ Potential DNS slowness or unresponsive DNS provider


2. Connection Time (ms)     TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) 
What it is:
 How much time taken to establish connection between client or customer and server once the IP is known.

Example:
After the IP is known, the browser tries to "shake hands" with the server to open a connection.

If this step takes 13 ms, then Connection Time = 13 ms.

🛎️ Alert Example:

⚠️ Alert: Connection time above threshold (200 ms) — possible server or network congestion.


🔄 This is how TCP works: The "3-Way Handshake"
To establish a connection between client and server, TCP uses a 3-step process called the 3-way handshake.

👇 Steps:
SYN (Synchronize)

Your computer says: “Hi server, I want to talk to you!”

SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge)

Server replies: “Okay, I hear you. I'm ready!”

ACK (Acknowledge)

Your computer: “Cool! Let’s start the communication.”

✅ Now the TCP connection is ready, and the browser can send an HTTP request to load the web page.



3. SSL Handshake Time (ms)
What it is:
Time to establish a secure (HTTPS) connection using SSL/TLS certificates.

Example:
The browser and server exchange encryption keys to make the connection secure.

If this takes 17 ms, then SSL Handshake Time = 17 ms.

🛎️ Alert Example:

⚠️ SSL Handshake taking longer than 100 ms — check certificate size or server crypto config.



4. First Byte Time (ms)  (How much time has taken to give First responce of sever from then send request to server)
What it is:
👉 From when your browser sends a request
👉 Until it receives the very first byte of data back from the server.

Example:
After connection and SSL setup, the browser sends a request like:
GET /home.
The server processes this and starts sending a response.

If the first byte comes after 12 ms, then First Byte Time = 12 ms.


🛎️ Alert Example:

⚠️ First Byte Time > 500 ms — Possible backend performance issue or database slowness.


🧾 Real Example (E-Commerce App)
Scenario:
Raj clicks "Add to Cart" on a product on www.shopnow.com.

His browser sends a request to the server like:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
GET /add-to-cart?item_id=123
What Happens:
✅ The request reaches the server.

🧠 The server:

Checks Raj's login session.

Queries the database.

Updates his cart.

Prepares the response (HTML/JSON).

📦 The first byte of that response is finally sent back to Raj’s browser.


Note:- It measures how quickly the server starts responding — not how long it takes to load the full page, just the start of the response.



5. Download Time (ms)
What it is:
Time to download the entire server response (like HTML, CSS, JS, etc).

Example:
After the first byte arrives, the browser downloads the full HTML page.

If this takes 165 ms, then Download Time = 165 ms.

🛎️ Alert Example:

⚠️ Download Time exceeds 1500 ms — Check image optimization or CDN usage.




6. Response Time (ms)
What it is:
Total time from start (DNS) to end (download complete)
