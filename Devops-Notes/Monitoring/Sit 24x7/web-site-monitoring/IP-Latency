# Latency
Latency = how long it takes for data to travel from source to destination
Purpose: Ensure customers can access the site quickly from all cities.


🧠 Why This Matters
Latency monitoring helps you:
Ensure fast access from all regions.
Detect regional internet provider issues.
Improve user experience by optimizing routing or using CDN.


🧠 Why This Is Useful
If this were a live shopping platform and a buyer in Kolkata was trying to complete a payment:

High latency could delay the transaction
Jitter might cause errors in secure communication (SSL handshakes)
The user may abandon the cart


🔎 Impact Analysis
User Experience Impact: Slow page load, payment timeouts.
Region Impacted: East India (Kolkata users).
Business Risk: Cart abandonment or failed orders during peak time.



🎯 What is Jitter?
Jitter refers to the variation in the time delay between packets arriving over a network connection.
It's measured in milliseconds (ms).
It represents inconsistency in latency.
Latency = how long it takes for data to travel from source to destination
Jitter = how much that time fluctuates between packets


🧠 Simple Analogy
Imagine you're waiting for 5 people to arrive one after another for a meeting. They’re supposed to come at 1-minute intervals:
If they arrive like: 1:00, 1:01, 1:02, 1:03, 1:04 → No jitter.
But if they arrive: 1:00, 1:05, 1:02, 1:10, 1:01 → High jitter.
That fluctuation in arrival time is jitter.



⚠️ Why High Jitter is Bad
High jitter affects:

📦 Data Packets
Packets may arrive out of order, or get dropped.
Systems try to reassemble or re-request them, adding delay.

💬 Real-time Services
VoIP Calls: Choppy audio
Video Calls: Freezes or lag
Gaming: Rubber-banding or delay
Checkout pages: Connection drops or delayed payment processing


| Jitter Range | Network Quality |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| 0–1 ms       | Excellent       |
| 1–3 ms       | Acceptable      |
| >3 ms        | Poor (unstable) |



# Alert condition

| Metric    | Alert Threshold Example         |
| --------- | ------------------------------- |
| Latency   | > 30 ms                         |
| Jitter    | > 3 ms                          |
| Hop Count | > 15 hops                       |
| AS Count  | > 4 (too many networks)         |
| MTU       | ≠ expected (fragmentation risk) |


Hop Count = The number of routers or network devices data passes through from the source (monitoring location) to your server.



📊 What is AS Count?
AS Count is the number of different autonomous systems your network traffic passes through from the user (client) to the destination server.
More AS hops = more potential points of failure, delay, or instability.

🛍️ Example – E-Commerce Customer Journey
Let’s say a customer in Kolkata is trying to access your e-commerce site:

User Device (Kolkata)
↓
ISP (Airtel) → AS45678
↓
National Backbone Router → AS9587
↓
International Exchange Point → AS3356
↓
Cloud Provider (e.g., AWS) → AS16509
↓
Your Application Load Balancer → AS65999

🧮 Total AS Count = 5
This is already a bit high. If Site24x7 reports:

AS Count > 4 = Warning

It means the data is crossing through too many independently managed networks, which can cause:

Increased latency
Higher jitter
Possible packet loss
Troubleshooting complexity (hard to isolate faults)
