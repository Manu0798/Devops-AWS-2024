# What is Figma
-> Figma is a cloud-based design and collaboration tool mainly used for UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) design
-> It’s popular because it runs in the browser (and also has desktop & mobile apps), which makes it easy for multiple people to work together in real time

Key Features of Figma:
-> Real-time Collaboration: Multiple designers, developers, or stakeholders can work on the same file at the same time.
-> Cross-Platform: Works on Windows, macOS, Linux (via browser), and has mobile apps for iOS and Android.
-> Cloud-Based: No need to constantly send files back and forth—everything is saved in the cloud automatically.
-> Version History: Tracks all changes made to a design.
-> Prototyping: You can link screens and add interactions to show how an app or website will work, without writing code.
-> Plugins & Widgets: Extend functionality with icons, stock photos, charts, AI tools, etc.
-> Developer Handoff: Developers can inspect designs, view CSS properties, and download assets without needing special software.

# Who Uses Figma?
-> Designers → Create wireframes, UI/UX mockups, and prototypes.
-> Developers → Inspect design specs and get assets.
-> Product Managers & Clients → Review and comment directly on designs.

# All projects
-> We don't have chance to create multiple pages, we can able to only Threee pages.
