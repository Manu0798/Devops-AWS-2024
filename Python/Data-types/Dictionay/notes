# What is Dictionaries
A dictionary in Python is a data structure that allows you to store and retrieve values using keys.
-> It is mutable

# What is the difference between Dictionary and list, string, typle
name = "manoj"   -> It is string it store the one data
frineds = ["manoj", "raja", "ravi"]     -> It is list give the multiple without any properties
frineds = ("manoj", "raja", "ravi")     -> It is tuple give the multiple without any properties
-> Suppose if you want to create any ec2 instance you cant create using above data types because they wont provide properties and key value pair as like below dictionary
ec2_instance = {
    "name": "Instance1",
    "instance_type": "t2.micro",
    "key_pair": "manoj"
}
