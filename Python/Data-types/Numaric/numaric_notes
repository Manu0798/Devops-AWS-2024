# What is Numeric data type
-> Python supports three primary numeric data types: 
1) int for integers 
2) float for floating-point numbers.
3) Complex

# What is integers (int)
-> All the positive and negetive whole numbers without decimal points.
-> represented as "int"
    Ex : 10, 0, -100, -5000, 276
-> Default value -> 0
-> int() : is used check the default value of integer

# What is float
-> All the positive and negetive number with decimal point
-> represented as "float"
     Ex: 10.55, -500.0, -0.67, 0.0
-> default value -> 0.0
-> float() : used to check default value of float

# What is Complex
-> Represents complex numbers. Example: z = 2 + 3j
-> Specified as (real part)+(imaginary part)
   Ex:- 10+3j
