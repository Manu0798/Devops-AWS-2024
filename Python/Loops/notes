# What is Loop in python
-> Loops are a fundamental concept in programming, and they allow you to perform repetitive tasks efficiently. In Python, there are two primary types of loops: "for" and "while."

# What is For loop
-> The "for" loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) and execute a set of statements for each item in the sequence. The loop continues until all items in the sequence have been processed.
ex:-
for variable in sequence:
for is keyword
variable = Give whatever name do you want
in keyword
sequence = list, tuple, range

# While Loop
-> The "while" loop continues to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It's often used when you don't know in advance how many times the loop should run.
Ex:-
while condition:


# What is the difference For loop and While loop
# For Loop
-> When you know fixed number then you will use for loop

# While loop
-> When dont you know fixed number then you will use while loop
